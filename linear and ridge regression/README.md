## 📌 Projects Included

---

## 1. Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression 🚘

- Built a baseline regression model using **Linear Regression**
- Performed full preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling
- Predicted car prices based on key input attributes such as mileage, age, and specifications

**Algorithm Used:**  
- Linear Regression  

**Task Type:** Regression

## 2. Car Price Prediction using Ridge Regression 🔧

- Implemented **Ridge Regression** to improve generalization through regularization
- Conducted preprocessing steps such as normalization, feature transformation, and dataset cleaning
- Reduced overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the regression model

**Algorithm Used:**  
- Ridge Regression  

**Task Type:** Regression
